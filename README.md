# fcrepo Transform [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-transform.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-transform)

fcrepo-transform allows you to set up and publish transformations of the RDF that composes a Fedora object's representation. You can use SPARQL for RDF-to-RDF transformations, or LDPath for RDF-to-named-fields transformations. 

Example uses might include:
* Presenting different views of an object's metadata to different audiences
* Live-translating from one kind of metadata to another
* Filling in the fields of an HTML form for editing metadata
